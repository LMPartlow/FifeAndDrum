The Young Colonials Fyfe & Drum Corps formed in Lake Carmel, NY in 1973.  The corps has spent the past forty years introducing young people ages 8 - 18 to America's history.  Corps members learn how to march and eventually to play the fife - a small, wooden, flute-like instrument with six holes or rudimental snare or bass drums - rope tension drums.  The Young Colonials are instructed by professional musicians including past members of West Point Hellcats.  The corps marches in about 30 community and firemen parades, competitions and musters throughout the year.  The Young Colonials have performed in Niagara Falls - US & Canadian sides, Busch Gardens VA, Greenfield Village, MI, Washington DC, Colonial Williamsburg, Boston, MA, Cedar Point Amusement Park, OH, Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Lugano, Switzerland and Disney World Florida FIVE times! The Young Colonials host their own muster (colonial music festival) the third Saturday of August for the past 31 years.  Click on "The Muster" tab for more details!
